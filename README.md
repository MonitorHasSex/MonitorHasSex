### Welcome to my profile

I am a beginner trying to learn basic programming.

Currently trying to learn about:
* HTML/CSS (mainly more about it)
* C# (Game Design and Programs in general)
* Python (Discord bots, Webscraping)
* C++ (maybe)

Goals:
* Create a decent vr game
* Make a decent website to fuck around on
* Make a decent program in C#

### What I plan on using this github page for:
* Publishing convenient little programs
* Some open source games
* Whatever else I feel I should publish on here

Thank you for visiting my profile, enjoy :D
